# ACN

ShowShark groups **ACN (ANSI E1.17)** traffic under **Lighting â†’ ACN**.  
This dissector helps verify that devices implementing ACN correctly encapsulate lighting data.

Use this view to:
- Inspect ACN root layer, framing layer, and DMP structure.
- Validate the wrapping used for derived protocols (such as sACN).
- Confirm source identifiers, vectors, and data integrity.

Use the following pages for related protocols:
- [sACN](4-3-1-1_sacn.md)
- [Per-Channel Priority](4-3-1-2_per_channel_priority.md)
