ShowShark is a Wireshark plugin for entertainment networks. The aim is simple: make show‑network traffic easier to understand and issues faster to diagnose.

It shows communication between show devices in a clearer, more readable way than Wireshark alone.

It runs inside Wireshark with minimal setup and is read‑only, so it never changes your network.

As a capture runs, ShowShark learns about devices from the traffic and applies that context across relevant packets.

It works with live or saved captures, needs no special hardware, and processes everything locally.

### What you get
- Clear names instead of cryptic numbers
- Consistent labels across packets
- Faster checks for common show tasks
- A simple, readable view that stays out of your way

*ShowShark will grow over time. The goal stays the same: keep show networking clear and practical.*
